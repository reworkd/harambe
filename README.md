for interacting with the web. It provides a unified interface and runtime
for both manual and automatically created web extractors

## Setup and Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command using pip or a package manager of your choice.
```shell
pip install harambe-sdk
```

## SDK Methods

### sdk.capture_html()
Captures the raw HTML of the `selector` passed and defaults to capturing the entire document.
If any `exclude_selectors` are passed, they are excluded from the capture.
The captured HTML is saved to the server and the URL is returned.

Parameters:
- `selector` (str): CSS selector of element to capture, defaults to "html" for the document element
- `exclude_selectors` (Optional[List[str]]): List of CSS selectors for elements to exclude from capture
- `soup_transform` (Optional[func]): Function to transform the BeautifulSoup HTML before saving it

Returns:
`HTMLMetadata` object which contains the following keys:
- `html` - captured HTML as a string
- `text` - inner text of the captured HTML as a string
- `filename` - file name of the saved file
- `url` - URL for the file when saved on the server

### sdk.llm()
Call an LLM agent to evaluate any prompt for a string or ElementHandle or image URL.
If an image URL is passed to `to_evaluate` then `is_image_url` must be set to true.
If passing an ElementHandle, `include_screenshot` can be set to true to include a screenshot.
Agents supported currently ("openai").
Any model supported by the agent sdk can be used.

Parameters:
- `to_evaluate` (Optional[ElementHandle | str]): The ElementHandle or string or image URL to evaluate.
- `is_image_url` (bool): Whether the `to_evaluate` param is an image URL or not, defaults to False.
- `prompt` (str): The prompt to use for the evaluation.
- `data_type` (SchemaFieldType): The type of data to return.
- `include_screenshot` (bool): Whether to include the screenshot of the element in the response (Playwright only)
- `agent` (Optional[LLM_AGENTS]): The LLM agent to use, defaults to "openai".
- `model` (Optional[str]): The model to use, defaults to "gpt-4o-mini" for openai agent.
- `return_object_format` (Optional[object]): The dict format to return the data in.

Returns:
  string response received from the agent


## Example Scrapers

Generally scrapers come in two types, **listing** and detail **scrapers**. Listing
scrapers are used to collect a list of items to scrape. Detail scrapers
are used to scrape the details of a single item.

If all the items that you want to scrape are available on a single page,
then you can use a detail scraper to scrape all the items. If the
items are spread across multiple pages, then you will need to use a
listing scraper to collect the items and then use a detail scraper to
scrape the details of each item.

#### Detail Only Scraper

Shown below is an example detail scraper. The `context` parameter is
used to pass data from the listing scraper to the detail scraper.
In this example, the `context` parameter is used to pass the phone

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Any

from playwright.async_api import Page

from harambe import SDK

async def scrape(sdk: SDK, url: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
  page: Page = sdk.page
  await page.goto(url)
  await page.wait_for_selector("#main_content a")
  cards = await page.query_selector_all("#main_content a")
  for card in cards:
    title = await card.inner_text()
    href = await card.get_attribute("href")
    if title and href:
      await sdk.save_data(
        {
          "title": title,
          "document_url": href,
        }
      )


if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(
    SDK.run(
      scrape,
      "https://food.kp.gov.pk/page/rules_and_regulations",
      schema={},
    )
  )
```

#### Listing Scraper

Shown below is an example listing scraper. Use `SDK.enqueue` to to add
urls that will need be scraped by the detail scraper. The `context`
parameter is used to pass data from the listing scraper to the detail
scraper.

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Any

from playwright.async_api import Page

from harambe import SDK


async def listing_scrape(sdk: SDK, url: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
  page: Page = sdk.page
  await page.wait_for_selector(".artlist a")
  docs = await page.query_selector_all(".artlist a")
  for doc in docs:
    href = await doc.get_attribute("href")
    await sdk.enqueue(href)

  async def pager():
    next_page_element = await page.query_selector("li[title='Next'] > a")
    return next_page_element

  await sdk.paginate(pager)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(
    SDK.run(
      listing_scrape,
      "https://kpcode.kp.gov.pk/homepage/list_all_law_and_rule/879351",
      headless=False,
      schema={},
    )
  )
```

## Local Development
Harambe uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for dependency management. 
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/reworkd/harambe.git
cd harambe/sdk
uv sync
uv run playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

Finally, you can run tests to verify that everything is working correctly by running the
following command in the root directory of the repository:
```shell
./check.sh
```
