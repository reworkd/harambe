# Harambe
Harambe is the extraction SDK for Reworkd. It provides a simple interface 
for interacting with the web. It provides a unified interface and runtime 
for both manual and automatically created web extractors

## Setup and Installation
To install Harambe, clone the repository and install the requirements.
All requirements are managed via [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/reworkd/harambe.git
poetry install
```

## Folder Structure
The `scrapers` folder contains all the scrapers. The `harambe` folder
contains the SDK and utility functions.

## Example Scraper
Generally scrapers come in two types, **listing** and detail **scrapers**. Listing
scrapers are used to collect a list of items to scrape. Detail scrapers
are used to scrape the details of a single item. 

If all the items that you want to scrape are available on a single page, 
then you can use a detail scraper to scrape all the items. If the 
items are spread across multiple pages, then you will need to use a
listing scraper to collect the items and then use a detail scraper to
scrape the details of each item.

ALL scrapers must be decorated with `SDK.scraper`. This decorator
registers the scraper with the SDK and provides the SDK with the
necessary information to run the scraper.

#### Detail Only Scraper
Shown below is an example detail scraper. The `context` parameter is
used to pass data from the listing scraper to the detail scraper.
In this example, the `context` parameter is used to pass the phone

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Any

from playwright.async_api import Page

from harambe import SDK
from harambe import PlaywrightUtils as Pu

SELECTORS = {
    "last_page": "",
    "list_view": "//div[@class='et_pb_blurb_content']",
    "name": "//h4/*[self::span or self::a]",
    "fax": ">Fax.*?strong>(.*?)<br>",
    # etc...
}


# Annotation registers the scraper with the SDK
@SDK.scraper(domain="https://apprhs.org/our-locations/", stage="detail")
async def scrape(sdk: SDK, url: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
    page: Page = sdk.page

    locations = await page.locator(SELECTORS["list_view"]).all()
    for location in locations:        
        # Save the data to the database or file
        await sdk.save_data(
            {
                "name": await Pu.get_text(location, SELECTORS["name"]),
                "fax": await Pu.parse_by_regex(location, SELECTORS["fax"]),
                # etc...
            }
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(SDK.run(scrape, "https://apprhs.org/our-locations/"))
```


#### Listing Scraper
Shown below is an example listing scraper. Use `SDK.enqueue` to to add
urls that will need be scraped by the detail scraper. The `context`
parameter is used to pass data from the listing scraper to the detail
scraper. 

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Any

from playwright.async_api import Page

from harambe import SDK

SELECTORS = {}


@SDK.scraper(domain="https://example.org", stage="listing")
async def scrape(sdk: SDK, url: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
    page: Page = sdk.page

    for url in [
        "https://example.org/1",
        "https://example.org/2",
        "https://example.org/3",
    ]:  # Imagine these are locators
        await sdk.enqueue(
            url,
            context={
                "phone": "123-456-7890",
                # Some data from the listing page that we want to pass to the detail page, (optional)
                "foo": "bar",
                "baz": "qux",
            },
        )


@SDK.scraper(domain="https://example.org", stage="detail")
async def scrape_detail(sdk: SDK, url: str, context: Any) -> None:
    page: Page = sdk.page

    # Grab all properties from the context
    detail = {**context}

    detail["fax"] = "123-456-7890"  # Some data grabbed from the detail page
    detail["type"] = "Hospital"  # Some data grabbed from the detail page
    await sdk.save_data(detail)  # Save the data to the database


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(SDK.run(scrape, "https://navicenthealth.org/locations"))
    asyncio.run(SDK.run_from_file(scrape_detail))
```


#### Using Cache
The code below is an example detail scraper that relies on HAR cache
that it creates during initial run, subsequently using it as source
of data to improve speed and consume less bandwidth.

```python
import asyncio
import os.path
from typing import Any

from playwright.async_api import Page

from harambe import SDK
from harambe import PlaywrightUtils as Pu

HAR_FILE_PATH = "bananas.har"
SELECTORS = {
    "last_page": "",
    "list_view": "//div[@class='et_pb_blurb_content']",
    "name": "//h4/*[self::span or self::a]",
    "fax": ">Fax.*?strong>(.*?)<br>",
    # etc...
}


async def setup(sdk: SDK) -> None:
    page: Page = sdk.page

    already_cached = os.path.isfile(HAR_FILE_PATH)

    if already_cached:
        await page.route_from_har(HAR_FILE_PATH, not_found="fallback")
    else:
        await page.route_from_har(HAR_FILE_PATH, not_found="fallback", update=True)


# Annotation registers the scraper with the SDK
@SDK.scraper(domain="https://apprhs.org/our-locations/", stage="detail")
async def scrape(sdk: SDK, url: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
    page: Page = sdk.page

    locations = await page.locator(SELECTORS["list_view"]).all()
    for location in locations:
        # Save the data to the database or file
        await sdk.save_data(
            {
                "name": await Pu.get_text(location, SELECTORS["name"]),
                "fax": await Pu.parse_by_regex(location, SELECTORS["fax"]),
                # etc...
            }
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(SDK.run(scrape, "https://apprhs.org/our-locations/", setup=setup))
```


## Running a Scraper
You can use poetry to run a scraper. The `run` command takes the
scraper function and the url to scrape. The `run_from_file` command
takes the scraper function and the path to the file containing the
urls to scrape.

```shell
poetry run python poetry run python scrapers/medical/apprhs.py 
```

Before submitting a PR, please run the following commands to ensure
that your code is formatted correctly.

```shell
make format lint
```

Happy extraction! ü¶ç
